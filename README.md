# NCHManager

Non-cultural heritage project management system.

## Introduction

This is the major project of software engineering from my undergraduate studies, and I'm uploading it today for archiving. It's developed using Java Web, with a separation of front-end and back-end, implementing basic functions like access control and data management. The pages are also quite aesthetically pleasing.  
For a detailed project introduction, you can refer to the [reporter](./reporter.pdf) file.
